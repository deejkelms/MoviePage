Kindur Movie Search

## Getting started

* clone the repository and cd into it
* run `yarn install` or `npm install` to install dependencies
* run `yarn start` or `npm start` to get up and running!

This is a basic website where I attempted to follow the design spec as close as I could.

## Didn't Finish

* Update the styling in order to make it match the responsive layout.
* I would also like to update the styling for the cards and get more creative with some of the placeholder text
* To take it a step further I would like to add a Query field to dynamically update the search page and use the side nav to save your search selections
